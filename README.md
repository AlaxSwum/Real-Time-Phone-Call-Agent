```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Connect to Railway**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
3. **Set environment variables**: Add all required variables in Railway dashboard
4. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy

### 3. Configure Twilio Webhook

1. **Get your Railway URL**: After deployment, note your app URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

2. **Set Twilio webhook**:
   - Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
   - Navigate to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active numbers
   - Click your phone number
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-app.railway.app/voice`
   - Set HTTP method to: `POST`
   - Save configuration

3. **Test the setup**:
   - Call your Twilio number
   - Should hear: "Connecting your call, please wait..."
   - Gets connected to your bridge target number
   - Real-time transcription appears on dashboard

## üì± How It Works

### Bridge Call Flow
1. **Incoming call** ‚Üí Twilio number
2. **Greeting** ‚Üí "Connecting your call, please wait..."
3. **Bridge connection** ‚Üí Dials target number
4. **Real-time streaming** ‚Üí Audio sent to your Railway app
5. **Transcription** ‚Üí AssemblyAI processes audio in 2-3 second chunks
6. **Sentence output** ‚Üí Complete sentences displayed every 2-3 seconds
7. **Analysis** ‚Üí AI extracts intents, emails, meeting details
8. **Recording** ‚Üí Full conversation recorded for post-call analysis

### Technical Architecture
```
[Caller] ‚Üí [Twilio] ‚Üí [Railway App] ‚Üí [AssemblyAI] ‚Üí [Dashboard]
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì           ‚Üì             ‚Üì            ‚Üì
[Target]   [Bridge]   [WebSocket]   [HTTP API]   [Real-time UI]
```

## üéØ Optimizations for High Accuracy

### Sentence-Aware Processing
- **Buffer accumulation**: Collects partial transcripts
- **Sentence boundary detection**: Waits for complete sentences
- **Smart timeout**: Forces output after 8 seconds to prevent hanging
- **Quality filtering**: Skips silent or low-quality audio chunks

### AssemblyAI Configuration
```javascript
{
  speech_model: 'best',           // Highest accuracy model
  punctuate: true,                // Add punctuation
  format_text: true,              // Smart formatting
  speaker_labels: true,           // Identify speakers
  speakers_expected: 2,           // Bridge calls have 2 speakers
  word_boost: [                   // Enhanced accuracy for business terms
    'meeting', 'schedule', 'arrange', 'discuss', 'appointment',
    'email', 'call', 'phone', 'contact', 'business', 'work'
  ],
  boost_param: 'high'             // Maximum word boost effect
}
```

### Railway-Specific Optimizations
- **HTTPS URLs**: Railway provides HTTPS by default
- **Environment detection**: Auto-detects Railway environment variables
- **WebSocket compatibility**: Uses query parameter format for better compatibility
- **Static file serving**: Temporary audio files served from `/tmp`

## üîß Configuration Options

### Bridge Mode Settings
```bash
# Enable bridge mode (connect calls to target number)
BRIDGE_TARGET_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Disable bridge mode (analysis only)
# BRIDGE_TARGET_NUMBER=  # Leave empty or unset
```

### Transcription Timing
- **Minimum chunk**: 1 second of audio (8000 bytes)
- **Preferred chunk**: 3 seconds of audio (24000 bytes)
- **Processing interval**: Every 1.5 seconds
- **Sentence timeout**: 8 seconds maximum wait
- **Output frequency**: Complete sentences every 2-3 seconds

## üîó API Endpoints

### Webhooks (for Twilio)

- `POST /webhook/recording` - Recording completion callback
- `POST /webhook/dial-status` - Bridge call status updates

### Information
- `GET /` - Dashboard interface
- `GET /api` - API information and features
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /debug` - Detailed system information
- `GET /twilio-config` - Twilio setup instructions

### WebSocket
- `WS /?callSid=CALLSID` - Real-time audio streaming (recommended)
- `WS /ws` - Dashboard real-time updates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No transcription appearing**
   - Check ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Verify Railway app is receiving audio (check logs)
   - Ensure Twilio webhook is pointing to correct URL

2. **Bridge not connecting**
   - Verify BRIDGE_TARGET_NUMBER format (+1234567890)
   - Check target number can receive calls
   - Review Twilio logs for dial failures

3. **Audio quality issues**
   - Phone connection quality affects transcription
   - Ensure good cellular/landline connection
   - Check for background noise

4. **WebSocket connection failures**
   - Railway hosting may block some WebSocket connections
   - System automatically falls back to HTTP chunked processing
   - No action required - fallback maintains full functionality
